            After exploring the world's famous sites, Stoner D2 arrives in
            Serbia and discovers significant artifacts that shed new light on
            the history of the region. Through cooperation with local
            archaeologists, the robot will reveal fascinating stories about
            Serbia's past. His story begins at the archaeological site of Vinča
            and Starčevo, one of the most important Neolithic sites in Europe.
            The robot had the opportunity to explore this ancient city,
            discovering artifacts dating from the 6th to the 5th millennium BC.

            During its excavations, the robot found a special artifact - a clay
            figurine representing a female figure with prominent attributes of
            fertility. This discovery sheds new light on the religious and
            cultural practices of the Neolithic community of Vinča, revealing
            more about their beliefs and lifestyle. Cooperation with local
            archaeologists enabled a detailed study of this figurine, which
            resulted in new knowledge about Serbia's ancient past and its place
            in the context of European prehistory.

            Starčevo and their culture.Did you know that The Starčevo culture
            flourished roughly between 6200 and 5200 BCE, making it one of the
            earliest Neolithic cultures in the region.Starčevo settlements were
            typically located near rivers, lakes, or fertile plains, indicating
            an agricultural lifestyle. These settlements ranged from small
            villages to larger, more complex communities.The people of the

            with hunting, fishing, and gathering. They cultivated crops such as
