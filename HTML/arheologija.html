          Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory through the
          excavation and analysis of material remains, such as artifacts,
          architecture, ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. It is a
          multidisciplinary field that combines elements of anthropology,
          history, geography, geology, and other disciplines to understand past
          human cultures and societies.The primary goal of archaeology is to
          reconstruct and interpret the lifeways, behaviors, and cultural
          practices of past peoples. Archaeologists use a variety of methods and
          techniques to investigate archaeological sites, including excavation,
          surveying, laboratory analysis, and interpretation of data.
